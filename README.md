## Dockerised Tomcat App

QUICK RUN: To start the application you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and execute `./run.sh` in your shell.

ABOUT: This container was forked from another project and spun up as a learning process. The plan was to take this project, and infuse my own JSP site into it. It should build a docker container which uses `Tomcat`. It'll also build a `.war` file for deployment then auto deploy the war into the tomcat webapps container.
